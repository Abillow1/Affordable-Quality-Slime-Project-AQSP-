Thank you for supporting the Affordable Quality Slime Project (AQSP)!

This project is being developed by Abillow. (As of 12-2-2024)

This is a 100% OPEN SOURCE PROJECT and is licensed under the CC BY-SA 4.0!

This means that you (yes, YOU!) can build it too! Or edit it to make it better! (or just to make it look cool!!)

You can find this project here: https://github.com/Abillow1/Affordable-Quality-Slime-Project-AQSP-

Oh, by the way, this is meant to cost $7.50 for each tracker. If it cost you more than that, something's fishy. (You may pay more for fast production, warranties, and more. Before getting mad, be sure to check what you paid for!!)

Enjoy your new FBT set!!
