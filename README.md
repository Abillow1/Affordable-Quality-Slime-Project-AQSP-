# Affordable Quality Slime Project (AQSP)

The main goal of this project is to develop a as low as possible BMI270-based FBT tracker. This tracker is to be sold for $7.50 or less, with straps included. This would allow most users of VR to buy FBT, and have a better experience in VR. On the seccond hand, this tracker would serve as a gateway product for users to get involved with Slime, increasing support and passively making some users gain a interest to the inner-workings of it, making select users encouraged to learn about circuitry and more.

# **Projected Specs**
- ~20 hours play time
- ~3 hour charge time (*projected*)
- 69mm long, 29mm wide (might change), ~36mm thick (TBD)
- USB-C charging
- 20m wide straps
- Weight unknown, appx. ~175g


# Side Goals: (1/3 Achieved)

- Goal of 2 PCB's or less, integrating the sensor and charging chip onto the main PCB **[** Currently: 3 PCB's **]**
 
  ^^*may be scrapped as it is cheaper to keep seperate*^^
- Total manufacturing cost of $4 or less **[** Currently: ~$5 **]**
- Easy manufacturing and small size ***Partially Achieved***

  ^^Restrictive due to 18650 battery^^
  
# Possible Ideas:

- ~~AA-style battery and battery charging dock for the 18650 battery, for reduced cost (Goal cost: $10/dock | Dock must have 5 ports, with a 10 port model for $17.50)~~ **SCRAPPED**

- A Raspberry PI or similar based Plug and Play WIFI router for easy 2.4Ghz wifi, for LAN only. (Goal cost: $20 +WIFI dongle) ***HIGH PRIORITY***
  
^^ *Possibly important for many quest users who do not have networking knowlage* ^^

# TO-DO
- ~~Update case design to mold around the battery~~
- Update BOM (again)
- Get PCB prototype & test
- Design PnP LAN router
- Make this Readme file look nice
- ~~Make open source~~
- **Make Readme up to date**

# Physical Development

**Currently, this project has no physical development. A initial prototype is projected by next month.**

# Digitial Development

    Functionality Test Requiered. PCB prototyped, now smaller and efficcent. Case Design prototyped.

*Estimated prototype cost: $4.75 per tracker per batch, batch size of 500*
