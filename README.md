# Affordable Quality Slime Project (AQSP) EXPERIMENTAL BRANCH

The main goal of this project is to develop a as low as possible BMI270-based FBT tracker. This tracker is to be sold for $7.50 or less, with straps included. This would allow most users of VR to buy FBT, and have a better experience in VR. On the seccond hand, this tracker would serve as a gateway product for users to get involved with Slime, increasing support and passively making some users gain a interest to the inner-workings of it, making select users encouraged to learn about circuitry and more.

# **Projected Specs**
- ~8-12 hours play time
- ~2 hour charge time (*projected*)
- ~45mm long, 33mm wide (might change), ~30mm thick (TBD)
- USB-C charging
- 20m wide straps
- Weight unknown

# TO-DO

- Get PCB prototype & test
- Design PnP LAN router -IN PROGRESS
- Make this Readme file look nice

# Digitial Development

    Functionality Test Requiered. Case design needed.
    
**Current PCB Prototype**

*STL file for the screw is included in REV 1.0.0 release, I dont reccommend using in production*

*Choose your preferred 3D printer filament(s), PETG or better perfered*

# Hey, I want to sell this!

Well, you can as it is open source, but I wouldent, yet. Its still in prototyping, so its not quite production ready yet. But, you can help in its development! Get a prototype, print the case, if you see issues add them! (Or do that anyways, it is very appreciated) Also, if you sell these, be sure to ***read the attributes file carfully.*** There is a requierment that is not commonly seen in other projects.
