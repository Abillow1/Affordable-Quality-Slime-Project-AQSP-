# Affordable Quality Slime Project (AQSP)

The main goal of this project is to develop a as low as possible BMI270-based FBT tracker. This tracker is to be sold for $7.50 or less, with straps included. This would allow most users of VR to buy FBT, and have a better experience in VR. On the seccond hand, this tracker would serve as a gateway product for users to get involved with Slime, increasing support and passively making some users gain a interest to the inner-workings of it, making select users encouraged to learn about circuitry and more.

# **Projected Specs**
- ~20 hours play time
- ~3 hour charge time (*projected*)
- 69mm long, 27mm wide (might change), ~27mm thick (TBD)
- Satisfying and easy rocker power switch
- USB-C charging


# Side Goals: (1/3 Achieved)

- Goal of 2 PCB's or less, integrating the sensor and charging chip onto the main PCB **[** Currently: 3 PCB's + 1 switch **]**
- Total manufacturing cost of $4 or less **[** Currently: ~$5 **]**
- Easy manufacturing and small size ***Partially Achieved***
  
# Possible Ideas:

- AA-style battery and battery charging dock for the 18650 battery, for reduced cost (Goal cost: $10/dock | Dock must have 5 ports, with a 10 port model for $17.50)
- Consider a more expensive LSM6DSV model
- Possibly sell accessories for a profit
- A Raspberry PI or similar based Plug and Play WIFI router for easy 2.4Ghz wifi, for LAN only. (Goal cost: $20 +WIFI dongle) ***HIGH PRIORITY***
  
^^ *Possibly important for many quest users who do not have networking knowlage* ^^

# TO-DO
- Update case design to mold around the battery
- ~~Update BOM~~
- Get PCB prototype & test
- Design PnP LAN router
- Make this Readme file look nice
- Make open source

# Physical Development

**Currently, this project has no physical development. A initial prototype is projected by next month.**

# Digitial Development

    Functionality Test Requiered. PCB redesigned, now smaller and efficcent. Case Design in progress.
    
**Current PCB Prototype**
