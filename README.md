# Affordable Quality Slime Project (AQSP)
# **GOAL HIT, Functionality Test Requiered**

**Main Goal:** A slime tracker using a BMI270 sensor, 18650 battery, and including straps for at or under $7.50 each, with a goal of $5 each.

**Reason:** This would allow many users of VR to be able to get FBT (Full Body Tracking), letting people have better experiences in VR for a low cost.

# Side Goals:

- Goal of 2 PCB's or less, integrating the sensor and charging chip onto the main PCB
- Total manufacturing cost of $4 or less
- Easy manufacturing and small size

# Possible Ideas:

- AA-style battery and battery charging dock, for reduced cost (Goal cost: $10/dock | Dock must have 5 ports, with a 10 port model)
- Consider a more expensive LSM6DSV model
- Possibly sell accessories for a profit
- A Raspberry PI or similar based WIFI router for easy 2.4Ghz wifi, for LAN only. (Goal cost: $10 +WIFI dongle)
  
^^ *Possibly important for many quest users who do not have networking knowlage* ^^

# Development

**Currently, this project has no physical development. A initial prototype is projected by next month.**

*Estimated prototype cost: $4.90 per tracker per batch, batch size of 500*

Battery: YDL 18650 battery, $0.90 each for 500, 2000mAh 

^^ *Goal cost of $0.80 per tracker* ^^ 

Sensor: BMI270, $0.9663 each for 500

Battery Charging Chip: TP4056 Lithium Battery Charger Module, $18.61 per 100 

Microcontroler: D1 mini, $149 / 100 

^^ *Goal cost of $1 per tracker* ^^

Other: $1.30 per 500 trackers
