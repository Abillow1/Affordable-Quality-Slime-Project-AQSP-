# Affordable Quality Slime Project (AQSP)

**Main Goal:** A slime tracker using a BMI270 sensor, 18650 battery, and including straps for at or under $7.50 each, with a goal of $5 each.

**Reason:** This would allow many users of VR to be able to get FBT (Full Body Tracking), letting people have better experiences in VR for a low cost.

# Side Goals:

- Goal of 2 PCB's or less, integrating the sensor and charging chip onto the main PCB
- Total manufacturing cost of $4 or less
- Easy manufacturing and small size

# Possible ideas:

- AA-style battery and battery charging dock, for reduced cost (Goal cost: $10/dock | Dock must have 5 ports, with a 10 port model)

- A Raspberry PI or similar based WIFI router for easy 2.4Ghz wifi, for LAN only. (Goal cost: $10 +WIFI dongle)


# Development

Currently, this project has no physical development. A initial prototype is projected by next month.
