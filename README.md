# Affordable Quality Slime Project (AQSP)

The main goal of this project is to develop a as low as possible BMI270-based FBT tracker. This tracker is to be sold for $7.50 or less, with straps included. This would allow most users of VR to buy FBT, and have a better experience in VR. On the seccond hand, this tracker would serve as a gateway product for users to get involved with Slime, increasing support and passively making some users gain a interest to the inner-workings of it, making select users encouraged to learn about circuitry and more.

# **Projected Specs**
- ~20 hours play time
- ~3 hour charge time (*projected*)
- 69mm long, 29mm wide (might change), ~36mm thick (TBD)
- USB-C charging
- 20m wide straps
- Weight unknown, appx. ~175g


# Side Goals: (2/2 Achieved)

- Total manufacturing cost of $4 or less **[** Manufacturing cost is as low as reasonably possible **]**
- Easy manufacturing and small size ***Achieved***

  ^^Restrictive due to 18650 battery^^
  
# Possible Ideas:

- ~~AA-style battery and battery charging dock for the 18650 battery, for reduced cost (Goal cost: $10/dock | Dock must have 5 ports, with a 10 port model for $17.50)~~ **SCRAPPED**

- A Raspberry PI or similar based Plug and Play WIFI router for easy 2.4Ghz wifi, for LAN only. (Goal cost: $20 +WIFI dongle) ***CHECK FOR BRANCH, WIP***
  
^^ *Possibly important for many quest users who do not have networking knowlage* ^^

# TO-DO
- ~~Update case design to mold around the battery~~
- ~~Update BOM (again)~~
- Get PCB prototype & test
- Design PnP LAN router -IN PROGRESS
- Make this Readme file look nice
- ~~Make open source~~

# Physical Development

**Currently, this project has no physical development. A initial prototype is projected some time next month.**

# Digitial Development

    Functionality Test Requiered. PCB prototyped, now smaller and efficcent. Case Design prototyped.

# Hey, I want to sell this!

Well, you can as it is open source, but I wouldent, yet. Its still in prototyping, so its not quite production ready yet. But, you can help in its development! Get a prototype, print the case, if you see issues add them! (Or do that anyways, it is very appreciated) Also, if you sell these, be sure to ***read the attributes file carfully.*** There is a requierment that is not commonly seen in other projects.
